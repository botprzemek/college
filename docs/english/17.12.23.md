Hello, calling to Sylvia Garcia, this is Barry Clough speaking. I was wondering if there is someone else who's working at Zurich. I called your coworker and asked him to make sure You'll call me later, why didn't You call? Could you call me as soon as possible, please? I'm calling about the publicity material for Zurich Expo, which takes place tomorrow. The courier firm never reached yo. Did you finish your arrangements? Deadline is coming, we really need it - could You organize a new courier, please? I'm trying to make sure everything goes well.
